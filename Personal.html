			<h1 style="font-family:copperplate,fantasy;">Quote</h1>
			 <p style="text-indent:50px; font-family:times new roman,serif; font-size:17px">
			 This quotes comes from Al Pacino's Tony Montana in the film Scarface. 
			 He stated a couple things throughout the movie that resonated with me after watching it, and I qoute:
			  <blockquote>
			 "All I have in this world are my balls and my word, and I won't break them for anyone," </blockquote>
				<br/>
			<video width="320" height="240" autoplay muted controls >
			 <source src="Assets/AlPacino.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			 </video>
			 <br/>
			 He like this qoutes because it reminds him to always keep to his words and not to break it for anyone, 
			 and that the sort of person he wants to become, someone that others can depend on and look up to.
