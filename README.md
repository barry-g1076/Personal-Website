# Personal-Website
Welcome to my personal website! This website was created as my first assignment in a web development class, using HTML and CSS.

Here, you will find information about me, including my background, skills, and interests. 
I designed this website with a clean and simple layout, with easy navigation so that you can find what you're looking for quickly and easily. I used HTML to structure the content and CSS to style it, making sure that the website is visually appealing and easy to read.

As a beginner in web development, I am constantly learning and improving my skills. This website serves as a starting point for my journey and I hope you enjoy exploring it!
