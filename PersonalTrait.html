				  The personality test scores in the image above give a good idea of who Barrington is as a person. 
				  The results of the mental test indicate that he is an introvert, which is correct (if you read his biography, 
				  you would probably already know that). He prefers to be alone and dislikes crowds. His energy indicates that he is generally observant,
				  which is understandable given that he is a person who is more inclined to observe his surroundings if he is in an unfamiliar environment.
				  His nature, though, wouldn't say he's a person who acts on feelings, though if he doesn't like you or trust you, he would definitely tell you. 
				  It's safe to say he's a prospector.  He's skilled at improvising on the fly if necessary, and he's always on the lookout for fresh chances that can improve his life.
				  Barrington is a turbulent person. He's also self-aware and constantly striving to be a better version of himself.
